My name is Caleb Turner, and I'm a full-time freelance editor who’s passionate about reading, writing, travel, and exploring the outdoors. I grew up in the US and moved to Australia in 2019, and I’ve previously worked as a high school English teacher and in a sales and volunteer management role for a not-for-profit. That means I have a strong command of the Australian, British, and American styles of English, and I know how to promote a brand and communicate ideas with clarity and joy. My editing work includes blogs, novels, websites, letters, children’s books, poetry, and more.

Our editing service is priced competitively based on the level of detail you need:

* **Basic proofread (US$10/A$15 per 1000 words):** Spelling and major grammar points, punctuation, and capitalization

* **Detailed structural edit (US$30/A$45 per 1000 words):** Rearrange and rewrite sentences/paragraphs to be natural and engaging. Polish pacing and delivery, character/argument development; condense and reword confusing sentences.
