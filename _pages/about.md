I love bringing words to life!

When I was ten I started publishing a magazine for friends and family, and I haven’t stopped writing since. I studied computer science in my undergrad, then realised I needed to get closer to my passion of writing, so I got my master’s in English education. 

Small Planet Copyediting was born in 2019 during an epic road trip across the US. The name reflects not only my love for travel but my belief that words have the power to bring people together.

Today, I live in the tropical wonderland of Far North Queensland, Australia, where I also work as a high school English teacher. Having lived in both Australia and the US, and I’m familiar with American, UK and Australian English.

I’ve helped over 700 clients to date, from the US to the UK, from China to Canada, from India to Israel. I’ve gotten to work on novels, short stories, theses and dissertations, marketing collateral, blogs, social media posts, technical reports, product manuals, memoirs and more. Clients often note my attention to detail and my skill in getting tricky sentences to sound just right.

Whether your work needs a quick proofread, a full developmental edit, or something in between, I look forward to seeing how I can help!
