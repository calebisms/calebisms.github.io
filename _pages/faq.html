		<h3>Do your services include fact checking or plagiarism checks?</h3>
		<p>I don’t have the tools to do plagiarism checks. I might be able to help with fact checking depending on what field the work relates to. Just contact me to discuss!</p>
	</li>
	<li class='list-group-item text-black my-2'>
		<h3>How long does your service take?</h3>
		<p>Three days is the standard delivery time on most small orders. Many larger orders (over about A$300 or US$200) take 1-2 weeks. Before starting on your work, I'll provide an estimated time frame and check that this will work for you.</p>
	</li>
	<li class='list-group-item text-black my-2'>
		<h3>Can you provide faster delivery?</h3>
		<p>I can usually provide 24-hour delivery, especially for smaller projects for those only requiring proofreading. For smaller jobs, it’s US$10-20 or A$15-30 extra. Simply indicate that you need the service when you contact me and I'll confirm whether I can do it!</p>
	</li>
	<li class='list-group-item text-black my-2'>
		<h3>How do I pay?</h3>
		<p>I’ll send an invoice when the work is completed, and you can pay by card.</p>
	</li>
	<li class='list-group-item text-black my-2'>
		<h3>Do you offer discounts for larger projects?</h3>
		<p>I do! For projects of 10,000 words or over, I'm usually able to offer at least a 10% discount. <a href='/contact'>Contact me for more info.</a></p>
	</li>
	<li class='list-group-item text-black my-2'>
		<h3>What time zone are you in?</h3>
		<p>In September 2023, I'm Pacific Daylight Time. That's 7 hours ahead of Australian Eastern Standard Time, 9 hours ahead of Singapore time, and 8 hours behind the UK.</p>

		<h3>I'm not sure which service to choose, can you help?</h3>
		<p>To explain our three <a href='/pricing'>pricing levels</a> succinctly, a basic proofread is a check for typos and grammar mistakes. A standard edit will also make sure each line reads naturally, is consistent with other content, and doesn't repeat ideas. Finally, a detailed edit looks at the text as a whole, rewriting and rearranging as needed for a fully polished piece of writing. If you're still unsure, feel free to <a href='/contact'>send me a sample of your work</a> and I can show you what the different levels of editing would look like on it.</p>

		<h3>Can you guarantee that your edits will bring me fame and fortune?</h3>
		<p>Unfortunately, no.</p>
